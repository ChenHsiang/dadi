  abstract = {Population genetic analyses often use polymorphism data from one species,
	and orthologous genomic sequences from closely related outgroup species.
	These outgroup sequences are frequently used to identify ancestral
	alleles at segregating sites and to compare the patterns of polymorphism
	and divergence. Inherent in such studies is the assumption of parsimony,
	which posits that the ancestral state of each single nucleotide polymorphism
	(SNP) is the allele that matches the orthologous site in the outgroup
	sequence, and that all nucleotide substitutions between species have
	been observed. This study tests the effect of violating the parsimony
	assumption when mutation rates vary across sites and over time. Using
	a context-dependent mutation model that accounts for elevated mutation
	rates at CpG dinucleotides, increased propensity for transitional
	versus transversional mutations, as well as other directional and
	contextual mutation biases estimated along the human lineage, we
	show (using both simulations and a theoretical model) that enough
	unobserved substitutions could have occurred since the divergence
	of human and chimpanzee to cause many statistical tests to spuriously
	reject neutrality. Moreover, using both the chimpanzee and rhesus
	macaque genomes to parsimoniously identify ancestral states causes
	a large fraction of the data to be removed while not completely alleviating
	problem. By constructing a novel model of the context-dependent mutation
	process, we can correct polymorphism data for the effect of ancestral
	misidentification using a single outgroup.},
